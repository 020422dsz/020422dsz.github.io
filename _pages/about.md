I am Sizhe Ding, an international student currently at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/)ï¼Œ majoring in [MSCAPP](https://harris.uchicago.edu/academics/degrees/ms-computational-analysis-public-policy-mscapp)

My research interests lie in Environmental and Energy Policy, with a particular focus on the application of quantitative methods in these fields. I am particularly interested in machine learning and deep learning approaches, as well as statistical methods such as randomized trials, difference-in-differences (DID), and instrumental variables.

Additionally, I am proficient in using Python to build machine learning and deep learning frameworks and am experienced with popular libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch, as well as in data engineering and preparation.

I am currently preparing PhD applications, aiming to join a program where I can further develop my expertise in policy-oriented machine learning research and contribute to impactful projects in environmental policy and urban studies.
